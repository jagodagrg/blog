Blog is a flask application that can be used as a personal blog. The user can draft, publish, edit posts and delete drafts. Only the user logged in as admin can perform these actions.
The application needs to be run through terminal - first the requirements should be run using pip install -r requirements.txt
After that "export FLASK_ENV=production" should be run and finally "flask run".
Then the main page will be visible under http://localhost:5000/
